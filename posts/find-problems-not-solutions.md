Software is a solutions-oriented business. It's what we do: ship solutions as quickly as we can. But one common pitfall can be starting with solutions rather than problems. 

It seems obvious to say "start with the problem." But it's remarkably easy to forget when you are in the thick of solution-mongering.

My manager recommended this a few weeks ago in a specific context, and it was a great reminder.

There are a lot of benefits:

- **Problems provide a north star.** 
Starting with a problem asks the implicit question: "Do your solutions actually help?"

- **Problems are instantly understandable.**
Sharing the problem helps people understand the motivation for change. It can also help you understand your own plans.

- **Problems promote ownership.** 
It's more inspiring to get problems to solve than solutions to implement.

- **Problems allow for creativity.** 
Two people can look at the same problem and see different solutions. By sharing the problem, you might learn of new solutions.

Some examples of where this can help:

- **Defining a new tech lead role:** start with what problem the tech lead will work to solve, not what duties they will do.

- **Evaluating a new project:** start with what problem the project addresses, not what you plan to implement.

- **Making a process change:** start with the pains of the current process, not what you want the new process to be.
