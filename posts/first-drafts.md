For the longest time, I couldn't bring myself to start writing a novel. 

For most people, that's because they don't _want_ to write a novel. Not so for me. I've got an informal checklist of things to accomplish during my lifetime. Publishing a novel is on the list.

No, I couldn't begin writing a novel because I was fearful that it wouldn't turn out well. That it would validate deeper fears about the quality of my own writing. That it would cross me off some cosmic list of potential authors. 

I admit, these are silly fears. But I suspect they're not uncommon.

A little over a year ago, I joined a writing group. I started writing a novel, my fingers crossed that it would turn out well. If I were lucky, at the end of the process I'd make a few copy-edits and send it off for publication.

Well, I've written most of a draft now, and it's _not_ publishable. It won't ever be, without a lot of work.

I realized this fairly early on, maybe halfway through. That realization made for a lonely stretch of road on the journey. I was tempted to give upâ€”I had failed, right? 

Fortnately, my writing group gave me just enough motivation to question my surrender.

So I googled. What did other authors have to say about first drafts? How the heck are you supposed to write these things, anyway? Doing so, I ran across a quote from Shannon Hale. It went like this:

> "When writing a first draft, I have to remind myself constantly that I'm only shoveling sand into a box so later I can build castles."

I was very taken with that. It was a way to understand what I was doing and view it as productive. Incremental, even.

I think that's the trouble with huge undertakings. They take a long time to resemble what you envision, and it's easy to be discouraged. It's also hard to internalize the goals of the current phase you're on.

Analogously, at work we're starting to refactor a huge, ancient piece of code. It will likely take months or even years. I'm finding that this inspires similar concerns as I had, when I started writing the novel. What if...what if we draft up a refactor and it's not great? How should we view early brainstorms during this process?

Again, it was helpful to emphasize: sand in the box now. Sand-castles later.
