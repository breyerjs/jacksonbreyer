Well hey presto, I've finally set up a blog. 

In my typically efficient fashion, the first step was to create a custom blogging platform. It reads in markdown files and renders them into a React layout. Since I prefer to write in markdown _anyways_, I hope that should lower the barrier to writing these posts.

The tentative plan is to record whatever hobby I'm going deep on currently (it's always something...). But who knows? The sky's the limit. 

That's all for now. Catch you next time.
