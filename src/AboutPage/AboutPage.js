            <p>I am a full-stack developer on the Search Experience team at Yelp.</p>

            <p>"Full-stack" means that I write all sorts of codeâ€”in the frontend, in the backend, for infrastructure, for user-facing features, and so forth. It means that any given day can be quite unique. I enjoy that a lot.</p>

            <p>"Search Experience" means that I handle what a user experiences when they search. It's amazing how small, simple changes can have an outsized effect on a user's success.</p>

            <p>You probably know what Yelp means. But if you don't (or even if you do), feel free to <a href="http://www.yelp.com">take a look</a>.</p>
