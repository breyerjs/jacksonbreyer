            <p>I am a full-stack developer on the Search Experience team at Yelp.</p>

            <p>"Full-stack" means that I write all sorts of codeâ€”frontend, backend, user-facing features, infrastructure, and so forth. Each of my days can be quite unique.</p>

            <p>"Search Experience" means that I'm responsible for what a user experiences when they search on Yelp.</p>
