                <p>The next year I started my first full-time role as a Software Engineer.</p>

                <p>My story isn't unique, I know. Some of my brightest coworkers have drifted into programming from various liberal arts backgrounds. But when I was trying to make the jump, I clung to every scrap of knowledge that I could get my hands on. Hopefully someone can take something useful from my experience. It's not the only way to break into Software Engine</p>ering, and it might not even be the best. But it _is_ a way that worked for me. Consider yourself caveat-ed.

                <p>So.</p>

                <p>About five years ago I graduated with a degree in English and took work as a paralegal.</p>

                <p>Coming out of college, I had a taste for fantasy novels and diagramming sentences--yep, that kind of nerd. On its surface, law seemed like a natural fit: complex, rule-bound, allowing for ambiguity, lots of reading, etc. But the adage is "try before you buy". A JD, after all, can cost well over $100,000. So I decided to be a paralegal before I was a lawyer. The only place to offer me a job was a large, white-shoe law firm. So I took it.</p>

                <p>Experiences will vary in any role, and I've met some really happy career-paralegals. But I felt that my role was both tremendously stressful and uninteresting. The cases themselves were fascinating, of course. But somehow my role seemed to solely consist of collating binders at breakneck pace. Each day on the subway I'd finally untuck my shirt and think about how I hated the way I was spending my life.</p>

                <p>Things weren't working out. But what to do? Continue on and become a lawyer? Try something else? I was morose at work and wanted nothing to do with law. Nonetheless, I took the LSAT. I did okay. But law wasn't appealing anymor</p>e.

                <p>The cheshire cat says "If you don't know where you're going, any road'll take you there". I learned guitar, I learned to cook, I started learning foreign languages. "And," I said to my friend with a Computer Science degree, "by the way, how do I learn to program?" He said there was</p> this language called Python I should look at.

                <p>Then at 24 years old I wrote my first line of code.</p>

                <p>Right from the outset, writing code was really exciting. Maybe because there was a "secret arts" feel to it. Maybe because it tapped into the nerdy part of my brain that loves diagramming sentences. Whatever the reason, I was fascinated.</p>

                <p>But I wasn't sure what to do next. I wasn't in a class, so I needed to set up a curriculum for myself. But how could I do that when I didn't know the material?</p>

                <p>Internet forums were atwitter about beautiful sites that teach you to program with a sort of monkey-see, monkey-do ease. You know the type: Cade Academy and its clones. I didn't have any luck with these--I couldn't retain anything, learning by rote.</p>

                <p>After a lot of research, I discovered a book "Invent your own Video Games With Python" [ADD LINK]. It was helpful both as a reference and a curriculum. I would learn something new and then try to incorporate it into other programs I was writing.</p>

                <p>Working through the first few chapters gave me enough of a foundation to go Google my issues and blurrily understand what people were saying on Stack Overflow. Hunting for my own answers was both satisfying and helpful for my retention.</p>

                <p>I did a lot of projects during that period, and even took an community college course on Java, to make sure I _really_ loved this new thing.</p>

                <p>Still, an internship felt millions of miles away. I had no background and no formal training. I had no idea what a 'data structures' was, or why someone wanted me to take a course in it. Measuring my experience felt like an exercise in microscopy.</p>

                <p>I needed to learn more. A lot more.</p>

                <p>The way I figured, there were a few options: 1) Slog it out like I was doing 2) Enroll in a programming bootcamp 3) Shoot for a full-bore graduate program in Computer Science.</p>

                <p>Honestly, I didn't think I could become professionally competitive in any reasonable amount of time, on my own. I know other people who have done it successfully, but it was incredibly daunting to me. So that ruled out 1).</p>

                <p>Programming bootcamps have exploded in popularity over the last few years. About the price of a car, they're specifically targeted at people in my position, offering intense, personal instruction over a few months. Their pitch is that you don't really need several years of school to break into Software Engineering. Their ads are slick and beautiful; their sales pitches were inviting and optimistic.</p>

                <p>But here's the thing: they focus heavily on practical technologies rather than theory. 'Wait wait,' you might think, 'that sounds like a good thing.' Not really. The 'practical' technology du jour can vary from year to year. It's knowing the theory that allow software engineers to move between these short-lived trends, using tools like performance optimization, knowledge of systems, and more.</p>

                <p>Of course, good engineers come out of bootcamps too. But the theory is important, and I wanted to build a career, not get a job. So I felt uncomfortable betting my future on a quick-and-dirty course. 2) was out, so 3) it was. I applied to get a Master's degree in Computer Science.</p>
